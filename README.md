# README

#Mainpage and a series of tutorial levels have been implemented

#Code is pending refactoring, some DRYness is in order (considering implenting puzzles as MVC framework, would allow to plug in a build-your-own puzzle easier)

#Meat of the interesting code is in the views (specifically pages/howto, and assets/javascript).
